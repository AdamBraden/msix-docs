#Updating your icons and assets using the MSIX Packaging Tool

You can update or modify your app package assets during the conversion process, or once your package has been created, you can update them via the package editor. There are guidelines for icon and assets, so refer to those as you make your modifications. 

##Update your assets after your package has been created

Start by going to Package Editor, opening your MSIX package and navigating to the Package files tab. 

Within your assets folder, you can delete existing assets, or add new icons or assets. 
-To add a new asset file, select the assets folder, right click and select add file or add folder
-To delete an existing asset file, right click on the file, and select delete

Go back to the package information tab, and open your manifest file. Verify that the name of the assets you have added or remove, are called properly in your manifest file under the <uap:visualelements> node. 

##Modify your assets during the conversion process

During the installation process, we will be capturing any changes that you make to files or folders for your application. If you make changes to your assets during this time what we are monitoring, those changes will be captured in your final package.
