# Converting an installer with services

Coming in the 20H1 release of the Windows OS, you can run an MSIX package that has services in it. In order to get that MSIX with services, you can use the MSIX Packaging Tool to take an existing installer with services and convert it to MSIX

## Converting an installer with services using the MSIX Packaging Tool

You can go through the MSIX Packaging Tool as you normally would [link to walkthrough doc], select an installer that has services, and you will see the Services report page before being able to create your MSIX. 

The Services report page is a report of which services were detected in your installer during conversion. Services that have all the information they need and are supported will be shown in the ‘included’ table. Services that need additional information, need a fix, or aren’t supported will be shown in the included table.

To fix a service or see additional data about the service, double click on the service entry in the table. There will be a pop-up containing information about the service. Here you can see your service information that you can then edit if you need to.  

Key name: The name of the service - not modifiable in the UI
Description: The description of the service entry
Display name: The display name of the service
Image path: Location of the service executable – not modifiable in the UI
Start account: The start account for the service
Startup type: Type of startup for the service. Supports Automatic, Manual, and Disabled
Arguments: List of arguments to be run when the service starts
Dependencies: List of dependencies that the service has

Once a service has been fixed, you can move it to the include table from the excluded table or you can choose to leave it in the excluded table if you don’t want it in your final package. Then you can continue to the final step to create your MSIX package with services. 

## Known issues
- Not all services are supported right now. For a full list of what types of services are supported please check out this documentation [link to packaged services documentation]
- Currently the image path is not editable within the UI. In order to fix any issues with your image path, you will need to manually edit your service executable path before converting your installer. Alternatively, after conversion, you can edit the manifest manually using the MSIX Packaging Tool’s Package Editor.
- Currently we do not have a service report available in the Package Editor, so you will need to manually edit the manifest to make changes to the services included in your MSIX.
