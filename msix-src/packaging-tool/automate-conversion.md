# Automate conversion of Windows installers to MSIX packages

<div class="nextstepaction"><p><a class="x-hidden-focus" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/msix-packaging-tool/9n5lw3jbcxkf" data-linktype="external">Get MSIX Packaging Tool</a></p></div>

The MSIX Packaging Tool supports a command-line interface for creating MSIX application packages. This enables you to automate the process of repackaging app installers and perform bulk conversions.

For sample PowerShell and Bash scripts that demonstrate how to automate the process of packaging, signing, managing and distributing MSIX packages, see the [scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/MSIX-Toolkit/tree/master/Scripts) folder of the MSIX Toolkit.
