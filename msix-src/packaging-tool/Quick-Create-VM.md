 ## MSIX Packaging enviroment on Hyper-V Quick Create
 
We are happy to announce that we have made MSIX packaging even easier on windows 10. You can now create a virtual environment for MSIX packaging projects using [Hyper-V Quick Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine) feature added in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 

Simply type Hyper-V Quick Create in your start menu and select MSIX Packaging Tool Environment to get started. Once you finish going through the wizard, launch MSIX Packaging tool on the VM from the start menu.

Note: This feature requires Hyper-V. You can learn more about Hyper-V and how to enable it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v).
