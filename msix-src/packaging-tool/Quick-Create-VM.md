# MSIX packaging enviroment on Hyper-V Quick Create
 
You can create a virtual environment for MSIX packaging projects using [Hyper-V Quick Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine) feature added in the Windows 10 1709. 

Simply type 'Hyper-V Quick Create' in your Start menu and select MSIX Packaging Tool Environment to get started. After you finish the wizard, launch MSIX Packaging tool on the VM from the Start menu. Or if you have Hyper-V manager open, Click 'Quick Create...' and it will pop up the same UI. 

MSIX Packaging Tool Environment is a custom Windows 10 build that already includes MSIX Packaging Tool app and other pre-reqs so that you can get started with limited setup.
