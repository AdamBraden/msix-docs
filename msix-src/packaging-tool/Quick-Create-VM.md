# MSIX packaging enviroment on Hyper-V Quick Create
 
You can create a virtual environment for MSIX packaging projects using [Hyper-V Quick Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine) feature added in the Windows 10, version 1709. 

To get started, type 'Hyper-V Quick Create' in your Start menu and select **MSIX Packaging Tool Environment**. After you finish the wizard, start the MSIX Packaging tool on the VM from the Start menu. Or if you have Hyper-V Manager open, Click 'Quick Create...' and it will display the same UI. 

The MSIX Packaging Tool Environment is a custom Windows 10 build that includes the MSIX Packaging Tool app and other pre-requisites so that you can get started quickly with limited setup tasks.
