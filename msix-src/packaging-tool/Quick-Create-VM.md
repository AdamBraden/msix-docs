# MSIX packaging enviroment on Hyper-V Quick Create
 
We are happy to announce that we have made MSIX packaging even easier on Windows 10. You can now create a virtual environment for MSIX packaging projects using [Hyper-V Quick Create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/quick-create-virtual-machine) feature added in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 

Simply type 'Hyper-V Quick Create' in your Start menu and select MSIX Packaging Tool Environment to get started. After you finish the wizard, launch MSIX Packaging tool on the VM from the Start menu.

MSIX Packaging Tool Environment is a custom Windows 10 build that already includes MSIX Packaging Tool app and other pre-reqs so that you can get started with limited setup.
