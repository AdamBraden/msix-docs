# MSIX Resources 
Here is a list of our GitHub repository that will help you build MSIX packages. 

## MSIX Tool kit 
The [MSIX Toolkit](https://github.com/microsoft/MSIX-Toolkit) is a collection of tools and scripts focused on assisting IT Professionals and developers to enhance their app package modernization journey. The toolkit is open sourced hosted on GitHub to allow customers and enthusiasts to contribute directly and provide suggestions and feedback on the content that is available.

## MSIX Labs 
The [MSIX Labs](https://github.com/microsoft/MSIX-Labs) project is an effort to offer hands-on labs to help people become familiar with the different areas of MSIX. The content found within the MSIX Labs can be customized and become the basis for internal training.

## MSIX SDK 
The MSIX SDK is an open source project that allows developers to use the MSIX package format universally on all platforms. This allows developers to build experiences which are consistent for users on all platforms, and distribution methods. The SDK provides guidance for developers to package their app content and build an app package manifest in a way that it can target the platforms of their choice. This enables developers to package their app content once instead of having to package for each platform.
