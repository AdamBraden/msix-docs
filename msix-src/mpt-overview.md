# MSIX Packaging Tool 

The MSIX Packaging Tool enables you to repackage your existing Win32 applications to the MSIX format. It offers both an interactive GUI and a command line for conversions, and gives you the ability to convert an application without having the source code. We want to enable IT Pros to convert their existing assets to MSIX, to give them a better way to do packaging and app management.

MSIX Packaging Tool (Preview) is now available to from the Microsoft Store. You can run your desktop installers through this tool and obtain an MSIX package that you can install on your machine.

**Prerequisites:**

- Participation in Windows Insider fast or slow rings
- Minimum Windows 10 Build 17701 or later
- Administrator privileges on your PC account
- A valid MSA alias (to access the app from the Store)
 
To install MSIX Packaging Tool from Microsoft Store, go [here](https://www.microsoft.com/store/r/9N5LW3JBCXKF), making sure you are logged in with the MSA that is used for your Windows Insider Program. Next, go to the product description page and click the Install icon to begin the installation.
