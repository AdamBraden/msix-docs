# Optional Packages and Related Sets

If you're just starting out with Windows 10 optional packages or related sets, the following articles are good resources to get started: 

1.  [Extend your application using Optional Packages](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appinstaller/2017/04/05/uwpoptionalpackages/)
2.  [Build your first Optional Package](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appinstaller/2017/05/09/build-your-first-optional-package/)
3.  [Loading code from an optional package](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appinstaller/2017/05/11/loading-code-from-an-optional-package/)
4.  [Tooling to create a Related Set](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appinstaller/2017/05/12/tooling-to-create-a-related-set/)
5.  [Optional packages and related set authoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/packaging/optional-packages)

With the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, related sets can now be installed via App Installer. This allows distribution and deployment of related set app packages to users.
